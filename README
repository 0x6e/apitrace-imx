= Status =

* Only Direct3D 8 and 9 are supported at the moment.
* It has not been tested with many applications. Bugs may cause the application to crash. 


= Building from source =

Requirements:
* Python (tested with version 2.5)
* SCons (tested with 0.98.4)
* Microsoft Visual Studio (tested with 2005 version)
* Microsoft DirectX SDK (tested with August 2007 release)

Instructions:

* Invoke scons:

 scons debug=no dxsdk=C:\DXSDK
 
* You can write those options to a file named config.py:

 # config.py
 debug=1
 dxsdk='C:\\DXSDK'
 
* Invoke

  scons -h

See the scons manpage for more info.


= Usage =

* Copy d3d8.dll/d3d9.dll, d3dtrace.xsl, d3dtrace.css to the directory with the application you want to trace.
* Run the application.
* Open the output XML file with Firefox or Internet Explorer to view the log.
* For long XML files is better to use the d3dtrace-txt.xsl stylesheet together with a dedicated XSL processor like xsltproc, or msxsl.
