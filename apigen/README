This directory contains several helper scripts that facilitate the generation
of the API descriptions from specs.

The specs are not expressive enough, which is why we can just code generate
everything from them.

The typical procedure is to run

  make -B

and then manually crossport new functions / enums to the files in the top dir
via a side-by-side diff tool, such as gvimdiff.
